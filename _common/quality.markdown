## Unit Tests

Tests are used to confirm code compiles and functions as it should. Tests are created using *Google Test* and places in the `tests` directory.

To learn how to use Google Test I recommend to look through the primer they supply [on their github](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/primer.md).

## Report A Bug

We report bugs into Jira. This is done by creating a new issue in the backlog and marking it as a bug. Make sure it has a fitting title and a description that explains how to reproduce the bug.
