We don't have a standardized profiling application. Use whatever you are most proficient in.

Profiling happens at the end of every block where production stagnates anyway. The profiling is performed by a group of about 3 people who are proficient at profiling. Their task is to find any poorly performing systems and devised a action plan on how to make said system more performant.
