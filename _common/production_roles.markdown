For the event of a production member leaving the team we have set up a couple of procedures. This is done to make the switch of roles more fluent to prevent any stalls in development.

## Team Lead

* Responsible of the quality, coherency and functionality of the product.
* Responsible of attending the y3 production roundtables. Furthermore, facilitates communication and is responsible for the team.

The responsibilities of the programming lead are but not limited to:
